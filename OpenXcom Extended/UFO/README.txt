Copy all the UFO: Enemy Unknown / X-COM: UFO Defense subfolders to this directory!

If you can't write to this directory, you can also create a UFO folder in your
user folder (where your OpenXcom savegames are) and copy your UFO subfolders
there.

After the copy, this directory should contain at least the following items:
  GEODATA
  GEOGRAPH
  MAPS
  ROUTES
  SOUND
  TERRAIN
  UFOGRAPH
  UFOINTRO*
  UNITS
*optional

If you want to import your old games, copy the GAME_* folders to the
directory where your OpenXcom saves are.
